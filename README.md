# ALIGNMENT

> A Protocol for Real Human Connection

**No photos. One conversation at a time. Daily choice. Clean endings.**

---

## Overview

ALIGNMENT is not a dating app. It's a connection protocol — a structured, intentional process for meaningful human connection, guided by AI and governed by choice.

### Core Philosophy

- **No faces** — You will not be judged by how you look
- **No bios** — No performance, no self-marketing
- **No competition** — One connection at a time
- **Daily choice** — Every day, both decide to continue
- **Clean endings** — No ghosting, no ambiguity

- **Days 15-20**: Deeper prompts, visual cues
- **Day 21**: The Reveal — photos and names unlock

### 🤝 Daily Handshake

## Philosophy

> "This is not a dating app. It's a protocol for intentional human connection, guided by AI, governed by choice, and protected from the chaos of modern dating."

### Why This Works

1. **Binary input removes performance bias** — Speed captures instinct
2. **AI orchestrates where humans fail** — Conversation, timing, closure
3. **Scarcity restores decision-making** — No infinite feeds
4. **Daily consent enforces honesty** — No ghosting possible
5. **Physical bias is delayed, not denied** — Connection before attraction
